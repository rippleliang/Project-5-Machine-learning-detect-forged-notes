# Project-5-Machine-learning-detect-forged-notes
This is a machine learning project for a forged notes detecting machine. I firstly used linear regression model to treat the missing value in the training dataset. Then, I used clustering like Kmeans and classification like logistic regression model to detect the forge notes. Finally, I created functions that can be used for production and created a web version with Streamlit to allow algo to run online.

Techniques: 
- Machine learning: Treating missing value with Linear Regression, Normalization, Logistic Regression, PCA, Kmeans, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score Analysis, Confusion metrics, Model Validation
- Data visualization: Explain variance ratio, Correlation Circle, Triangle correlation heatmap
- Statistics analysis and test: Normality test,  Q-Q plot, Shapiro-wilk test, Homoscedasticity test
- Library: Statsmodels, Scipy, Sklearn, Joblib, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Web: Streamlit
- French project title: DÃ©tectez des faux billets avec R ou Python
